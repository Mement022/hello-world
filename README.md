# hello-world
**My first repository**:
I'm Mement022, a *newbie programmer*. As many of you, **I dream to change this world somehow**. Just by existing we are actually changing it already, so... *we all reached that goal from the beggining*. Then the proper goal would be **improving the world as we know it**. We face unsustainability and unequality all across the globe. Nevertheless, we have never been more advanced as a society. We have a great opportunity nowadays to improve our environement as well as be helped by innovative technologies. **Let's make it together!**
